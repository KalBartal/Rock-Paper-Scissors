# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is my coding challenge submission for day #4 of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp, instructor-led training.

This is a simple application that asks the user for a choice between rock, paper and scissors then compares that against the computer's randomly generated choice based on the well known rock paper scissors game's rules. 

The application uses ASCII graphics to do display the user's and computer's choice

## Usage
