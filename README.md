# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This is my coding challenge submission for day #4 of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp, instructor-led training.

This is a simple implementation of the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The game allows the user to input their choice of rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer randomly selects a choice as well. The game then compares the choices and determines a winner or a draw.

## Getting Started

To run the game, simply download the python file and run it in your preferred Python environment. The game will prompt the user to enter their choice by typing 0 for rock, 1 for paper, or 2 for scissors. The game will then display the user's choice and the computer's choice, and announce the winner or a draw.

## Game Rules

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

## Error Handling

The game includes error handling for invalid inputs. If the user enters a number other than 0, 1, or 2, the game will display an error message and the user loses.

## Additional Features

The game includes ASCII art for each choice, displaying the corresponding image of rock, paper, or scissors.

## Conclusion

This is a simple and fun game that can be used to pass time or for friendly competitions. It can be easily modified to include additional features such as scoring or additional game modes. Enjoy!
